# Automorphism groups of the projective space and automorphism groups of smooth quadric curves

The file SubGps-AutP1xP1-PGL4.txt contains a Magma code which can be executed using the online calculator available at https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/ . It has the following features.

1) The function AutPn(points,images,n) returns the unique element of PGL_{n+1} which sends the points in Points to points in Images. Images and Points must form two sets of points of P^3 in general linear position.

2) The function AutQuadSurf(M1,M2,s) takes an element g=(M1,M2,s) of PGL_2^2\rtimes\C_2 = Aut(P^1xP^1) and returns the matrix of PGL_4 defining the automorphism whose restriction on the Segre embedding of P1xP1 is the automorphism g.

3) The function SGPGL(matrices) takes a set of invertible matrices, and returns the subgroup of PGL(n,C) generated by those matrices.

4) We run these functions with the examples given in Propositions [[]] of [[]]. To display the results, we use the buit-in magma functions IdentifyGroup(G) and GroupName(G), which gespectively return the GAP ID, if it exists, of a finite group G, and a simple description of its isomorphism class.
